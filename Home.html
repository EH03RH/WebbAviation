<div class="panel">

<br>
<br>
<p>
This mobile app gives the flying public real-time information for safe, healthy and smooth end-to-end journeys.

Air travel has become ever more challenging for passengers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, any attempt to reconnect to air-travel is countered by a myriad of varied – and often rapidly-changing – restrictions, making planning for any potential air-traveller difficult.

To help simplify the situation, Airbus developed the Tripset application as its contribution to rebuilding clarity and trust when travelling. The app provides the latest and most relevant up-to-date information covering all aspects of flight, from planning, booking, check-in to conditions while onboard and at the destination.

This new digital experience is based on the award-winning iflyA380 travel app, with everything at the user's fingertips in a single application that is updated twice daily.</p>

<h3>Hassle-free access to the latest travel information</h3>

<p>The Tripset app aggregates information from multiple sources, including guidelines from government websites and embassies on in-country conditions, region-by-region restrictions or requirements, along with health measures implemented by airlines and airports.
Another important feature is the border status of destinations around the globe: whether they are open, restricted or closed. Also included are suggestions for ground transportation at the points of departure and arrival, such as commuting options to and from airports.
All this information is provided in an agnostic manner; no matter the airport, airline, flight number or aircraft type…the app will take into account the full range of available inputs.
</p>

<h3>How to fly again soon</h3>

<p>Once a flight is booked, the passenger can import the trip specifics into Tripset, which then builds a personal timeline using all available data on the end-to-end travel conditions.
The app continues to provide information – even prompting the passenger when it is time to go to the gate, based on information from the boarding pass.
To benefit from this latest example of Airbus innovation in action – and to get back in the sky with confidence – download the free-of-charge Tripset app for Android and iOS devices from Google Play and the AppStore.</p>

<button class="accordion">Cryogenics and superconductivity for aircraft, explained - ASCEND aims for a breakthrough in electric propulsion for aircraft</button>
<div class="panel">
<br>
<img src="ASCEND-main image 2.jfif" style="width:100%"></img>
<br>
<br>
<p>A major breakthrough in electric propulsion for long-range aircraft could soon be on the horizon. The presence of a cold source, in the form of liquid hydrogen, alongside superconducting technologies promises to unlock new possibilities. Today, the ASCEND demonstrator project by Airbus UpNext aims to mature these technologies to significantly boost the performance of electric- and hybrid-electric propulsion systems in future low-emission aircraft.  
<br>
<br>
In 1911, Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes found himself preoccupied with one question: what happens to the electrical conductivity of pure metals at very low temperatures? During an experiment, he immersed a wire made of solid mercury into liquid helium, and to his astonishment, found the wire’s electrical resistivity completely vanished at 4.2°Kelvin (-268.95°C). 
<br>
<br>
He called the phenomenon “superconductivity,” or the ability of certain materials to generate strong magnetic fields and conduct very high electric currents with practically zero resistance when exposed to very low temperatures. The discovery was so ground-breaking, it earned Kamerlingh Onnes the 1913 Nobel Prize in Physics. 
</p>
<br>
<p>Today, superconductivity has a variety of practical applications, including the following:
<br>
  - Electrical power transmission cables
  <br>
  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) machines
  <br>
  - Particle accelerators and magnetic fusion devices
  <br>
  - Some electric motors and generators
  <br>
  </p>
<br>
  <p>However, superconductivity’s applications in the aerospace industry have yet to be fully explored. Airbus UpNext is looking to change that with its latest ground-based demonstrator project ASCEND.

<button class="accordion">An A350 fuelled by 100% SAF just took off
An Airbus-led study aims to better understand SAF’s emissions performance</button>
<div class="panel">
<br>
<img src="A350-take-off-flightlab.jpg" style="width:100%"></img>
<br>
<br>
  <p>The study of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)’s impact on the full scope of aircraft emissions has been few and far between. An Airbus-led project is looking to change that by conducting a series of flight and ground tests aimed at shedding light on the emissions performance of 100% SAF.
  <br>
  On a chilly but pleasant March day, an A350 moved into position, revved its jet engines and took off from the runway at Blagnac airport in Toulouse, France. But this was no ordinary flight: the test aircraft was fuelled by 100% SAF.
  <br>
  Today, all Airbus aircraft are certified to fly with up to a 50% blend of SAF mixed with kerosene. But the emissions performance of SAF when unblended with any type of fossil fuel has remained a question mark across the industry—until now.
  <br>
  The Airbus-led Emission and Climate Impact of Alternative Fuels project, in collaboration with Rolls-Royce, German aerospace research centre DLR and oil refining company Neste, has set its sights on providing insight on that very question.</p>

<button class="accordion">Corsair takes delivery of its first A330neo</button>
<div class="panel">
<br>
<img src="First-A330neo-MSN1975-delivery-to-Corsair-Group-picture-VIP-04.jpg" style="width:100%"></img>
<br>
<br>
  <p>Toulouse, 31 March 2021 - Corsair has taken delivery of its first A330-900, on lease from Avolon, to join the French airline’s fleet
<br>
<br>
By selecting a total of five A330neos, Corsair is executing its strategy to become an all-A330 operator. Thanks to the A330neo’s latest technologies, Corsair will benefit from cost-effective and eco-efficient solutions, while providing passengers with the best comfort standards in the quietest cabins in its class.  
<br>
<br>
The aircraft features 352 seats in a three-class layout, providing all the comfort and amenities of Airbus’ leading ‘Airspace’ cabin, including state-of-the-art passenger in-flight entertainment (IFE) and full WiFi connectivity throughout the cabin.
<br>
<br>
The A330neo is powered by Rolls-Royce’s latest-generation Trent 7000 engines. The Corsair aircraft will also be the first A330neo to feature an increased maximum take-off weight of 251 tonnes. This capability will allow the airline to fly long-haul destinations up to 13,400 km (7,200nm) or benefit from ten tons more payload on board.
<br>
<br>
The A330neo is a new-generation aircraft and successor to the hugely popular A330ceo widebody family. As well as the new engine option, the aircraft benefits from a host of innovations, including aerodynamic improvements and new wings and winglets that together contribute to 25% fuel-burn and CO2 reductions.
<br>
<br>
Corsair, which already operates an Airbus fleet of five A330 Family aircraft, became a member of the Airbus Skywise ‘Open Data Platform’ in 2020, thus benefiting from several Skywise-based services, such as  a real-time in-service fleet performance analysis capability (aircraft health monitoring), reliability analysis and predictive maintenance.
